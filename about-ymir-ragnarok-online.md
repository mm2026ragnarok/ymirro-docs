# About Ymir Ragnarok Online

**Ymir Ragnarok Online Episode 5** is a **pure classic, pre-renewal** private server.

## Core Identity

- 📜 **Pure Episode 5** – no content beyond the official Episode 5 era.
- ⚔️ **Pre-Trans Only** – 99/50 maximum, no transcendent classes.
- ⚖️ **Fair & Balanced** – no donations, no pay-to-win, no custom items.
- 🧪 **No Random Options** – all gear and stats follow official mechanics.
- 🛡️ **No GM Interference** – staff will never spawn items or MVPs for players.

## Server Rates

- Base EXP: **5x**
- Job EXP: **5x**
- Item Drop: **1x**

These rates are designed to feel like official gameplay, but slightly faster to fit modern schedules.

## Technical & Security

- **Gepard Shield 3.0** client protection  
- **Anti-DDOS** protected infrastructure  
- **Stable hosting** (location TBA)  
- **Dual client allowed** (within fair use)

## Philosophy

YmirRO is **for players who miss how RO used to be**:

> No overpowered customs, no donation gear, no shortcuts.  
> Just you, your party, and the world of Rune-Midgard.
